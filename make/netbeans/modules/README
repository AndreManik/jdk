Working on the Java ModuleSystem Using the NetBeans IDE

This NetBeans project allows a developer interested in learning about the
Java Module System to modify, build, test, and generate javadoc for it.


README FIRST

The file make/netbeans/README describes how to use NetBeans with OpenJDK
projects in general.  The rest of this file describes specifics of the Java
Module System.


WORKING WITH THE JAVA MODULE SYSTEM

The Java Module System source code is written in pure Java code.  Most of the
code is in
     java/module
     sun/module

There are a few related files in other packages (for example,
java/lang/ClassLoader.java).  The packages containing those files are part of
this NetBeans project.  But while those entire packages get built (and
cleaned) by this project, only a few files in those other packages are related
to the Java Module System.


The set of actions supported by this project are:

* Build Project:
  - Compiles the Java Module System source files and puts the class files
    under build/${platform}-${arch}/classes.

* Generate Javadoc for Project
  - Generates the javadoc for the all the packages that have code related to
    the Java Module System.

  - The javadoc is generated under build/${platform}-${arch}/javadoc/modules.

* Test Project
  - Runs jtreg unit tests located under test/java/module and test/sun/module.

  - The test results are written under
        build/${platform}-${arch}/jtreg/modules

    and the HTML test report can be found at
        build/${platform}-${arch}/jtreg/modules/JTreport/index.html

* Clean Project
  - Removes class files, test files, javadoc, etc., etc. created by this
    project under build/${platform}-${arch}
